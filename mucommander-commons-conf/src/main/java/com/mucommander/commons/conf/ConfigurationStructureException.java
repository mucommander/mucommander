/**
 * Encapsulate a configuration structure error.

 * are inconsistencies in the structure of the configuration tree - a section closed more
 * than once, for example, or never closed at all.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This exception is mostly meant to be used by implementations of {@link ConfigurationBuilder},
 * as they have to analyse the structure of the configuration they're receiving events for.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since <code>ConfigurationStructureException</code> subclasses {@link ConfigurationException}, it
 * inherits his capacity to wrap other exceptions.
