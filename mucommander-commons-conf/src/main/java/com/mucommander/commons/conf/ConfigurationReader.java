/**
 * Interface for reading from a configuration source using callbacks.
 * <p>
 * Application writers that need to implement a specific configuration format need to subclass this.
 * Reader implementations have the task of parsing an input stream for configuration data and invoking the
 * relevant callback methods of {@link ConfigurationBuilder}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>com.mucommander.commons.conf</code> package comes with a default implementation,
 * {@link XmlConfigurationReader}, which handles the standard muCommander configuration file format.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order for an implementation of <code>ConfigurationReader</code> to be usable by
 * {@link Configuration configuration} instances, it must come with an associated implementation of
 * {@link ConfigurationReaderFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition, most readers will have an associated writer used to write configuration files in a
 * format that the reader will understand.
