/**
 * <p/>
 * This class provides a way to fill a shape with a circular radial color
 * gradient pattern. The user may specify 2 or more gradient colors, and this
 * paint will provide an interpolation between each color.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The user must provide an array of floats specifying how to distribute the
 * colors along the gradient.  These values should range from 0.0 to 1.0 and
 * act like keyframes along the gradient (they mark where the gradient should
 * be exactly a particular color).
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * This paint will map the first color of the gradient to a focus point within
 * the circle, and the last color to the perimeter of the circle, interpolating
 * smoothly for any inbetween colors specified by the user.  Any line drawn
 * from the focus point to the circumference will span the all the gradient
 * colors.  By default the focus is set to be the center of the circle.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Specifying a focus point outside of the circle's radius will result in the
 * focus being set to the intersection point of the focus-center line and the
 * perimenter of the circle.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Specifying a cycle method allows the user to control the painting behavior
 * outside of the bounds of the circle's radius.  See LinearGradientPaint for
 * more details.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The following code demonstrates typical usage of RadialGradientPaint:
 * <p/>
 * <code>
 * Point2D center = new Point2D.Float(0, 0);<br>
 * float radius = 20;
 * float[] dist = {0.0, 0.2, 1.0};<br>
 * Color[] colors = {Color.red, Color.white, Color.blue};<br>
 * RadialGradientPaint p = new RadialGradientPaint(center, radius,
 * dist, colors);
 * </code>
 * <p/>
 * <p> In the event that the user does not set the first keyframe value equal
 * to 0 and the last keyframe value equal to 1, keyframes will be created at
 * these positions and the first and last colors will be replicated there.
 * So, if a user specifies the following arrays to construct a gradient:<br>
 * {Color.blue, Color.red}, {.3, .7}<br>
 * this will be converted to a gradient with the following keyframes:
 * {Color.blue, Color.blue, Color.red, Color.red}, {0, .3, .7, 1}
 * <p/>
