/**
 * ThroughputLimitInputStream extends InputStream to provide control over the transfer speed and limit it to a specified
 * number of bytes per second.
 * Whenever the bytes per second quota has been reached, the read and skip methods will lock and won't return
 * until either:
 * <ul>a new second commences, bringing the bytes read count back to zero for the new second
 * <li>{@link #setThroughputLimit(long)} is called with a more permissive bytes per second value (different from 0),
 * yielding to more bytes available for the current second.
 * <p>
 * <p>Setting the throughput limit to 0 effectively blocks all read and skip calls indefinitely.
 * Any calls to the read or skip methods will lock, the only way to remove this lock being to call the
 * {@link #setThroughputLimit(long)} method with a value different from 0 from another thread.
 * <p>
 * <p>Setting the throughput limit to -1 or any other negative values will disable any limit and make
 * this ThroughputLimitInputStream behave just like a normal InputStream.
 * <p>
 * <p>Finally, the {@link #setUnderlyingInputStream(java.io.InputStream)} method allows to use the
 * same ThroughputLimitInputStream instance for multiple InputStream instances, keeping the bytes count for the
 * current second intact and thus the throughput limit stable. This does not hold true if a new ThroughputLimitInputStream
 * is created for each InputStream, the bytes count for the current second starting at 0.
