/**
 * This class provides a proper implementation of an OutputStream filter.
 * <p>
 * <p>Unlike <code>java.io.FilterOutputStream</code>, this method delegates all methods to an underlying OutputStream
 * and nothing more. In particular, {@link #write(byte[])} and {@link #write(byte[], int, int)} do <b>not</b>
 * call {@link #write(int)} repeatedly (very unefficient) but delegate to the corresponding OutputStream methods. This
 * makes this class much safer to use from a performance perspective than <code>java.io.FilteredOutputStream</code>.
