/**
 * SafePipedInputStream is a <code>PipedInputStream</code> that can be safely interrupted when the thread that
 * pushes data to this stream has encountered an error. This can be done by calling
 * {@link #setExternalFailure(java.io.IOException)} with an <code>IOException</code> that will be thrown by
 * read/skip/available methods thereafter. This method ensures that the <code>IOException</code> will be propagated
 * to any thread that is currently executing a read/skip/available method of this class.
 * <p>
 * <p>This class overcomes a limitation of <code>PipedInputStream</code> whose read/skip/available methods do not
 * throw an <code>IOException</code> when the stream is closed from another thread in the midst of their execution.
