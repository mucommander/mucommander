/**
 * <code>BOMReader</code> is a <code>Reader</code> which provides support for Byte-Order Marks (BOM).
 * A BOM is a byte sequence found at the beginning of a Unicode text stream which indicates the encoding of the text
 * that follows.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This class uses a {@link BOMInputStream} for BOM handling and serves a dual purpose:<br>
 * 1) it allows to auto-detect the encoding when a BOM is present in the underlying stream and use it.<br>
 * 2) it allows to discard the BOM from a Unicode stream: the leading bytes corresponding to the BOM are swallowed by
 * the stream and never returned by the <code>read</code> methods.
