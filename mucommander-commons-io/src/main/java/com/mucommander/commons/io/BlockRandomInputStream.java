/**
 * <code>BlockRandomInputStream</code> is a specialized-yet-still-abstract <code>RandomAccessInputStream</code> that
 * is geared towards resources that are read block by block, either because of a particular constrain or for performance
 * reasons. This class typically comes in handy for network resources such as HTTP which have to request a block range
 * for reading the resource.
 * <p>
 * <p>Seeking inside the file is implemented transparently by reading a block starting at the seek offset.
 * If {@link #seek(long)} is called with an offset that is within the current block, no read occurs.
 * The block size should be carefully chosen as it affects seek performance and thus overall performance greatly:
 * the larger the block size, the more data is fetched when seeking outside the current block and consequently the
 * longer it takes to reposition the stream. On the other hand, a larger block size will yield better performance when
 * reading the resource sequentially, as it lessens the overhead of requesting a particular block.</p>
