/**
 * FileJob is a container for a 'file task' : basically an operation that involves files and bytes.
 * The class extending FileJob is required to give some information about the status of the job that
 * will be used to display visual indications of the job's progress.
 * <p>
 * The actual processing is performed in a separate thread. A FileJob needs to be started explicitely using
 * {@link #start()}. The lifecycle of a FileJob is as follows:<br>
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 * {@link #NOT_STARTED} -> {@link #RUNNING} -> {@link #FINISHED}
 *                         ^                |
 *                         |                -> {@link #INTERRUPTED}
 *                         |                |                      
 *                         |                -> {@link #PAUSED} -|
 *                         |                                    |
 *                         -------------------------------------|
