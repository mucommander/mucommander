/**
 * Saves file in as crash-safe a manner as possible.
 * <p>
 * In order to prevent system or muCommander failures to corrupt configuration files,
 * the BackupOutputStream implements the following algorithm:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Write its content to a backup file instead of the requested file</li>
 *   <li>When close is called, copy the content of the backup file over the original file</li>
 * </ul>
 * This way, if a crash was to happen while configuration files are being saved, either of the
 * following will happen:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     The backup file is not properly saved, but the original configuration is left untouched.
 *     We have lost <i>some</i> information (modifications since last save) but not <i>all</i>.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The original file is not properly saved, but the backup file is correct. This is easy to check,
 *     as the backup and original file should always have the same size. If they don't, then the backup
 *     file should be used rather than the original one.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Files that have been saved by this class should be read with {@link BackupInputStream}
 * in order to make sure that an uncorrupt version of them is loaded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>BackupOutputStream</code> monitors all of its own I/O operations. If an error occurs, then the backup
 * operation will not be performed when {@link #close()} is called. It's possible to force the backup operation by
 * using the {@link #close(boolean)} method.
 * </p>
