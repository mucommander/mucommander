/**
 * <code>AsyncPanel</code> is a <code>JPanel</code> aimed at components that potentially take a long time to
 * initialize. It allows to deport their initialization in a separate thread as to not lock the event thread.
 * It works as follows:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Initially, AsyncPanel displays a 'please wait component' that symbolizes the fact that the contents of the
 *      panel is being loaded.</li>
 *  <li>When AsyncPanel becomes visible on screen, the {@link #getTargetComponent()} method is called to trigger the
 *      initialization of the real component to display.</li>
 *  <li>As soon as the method returns, the wait component is removed and the target component added to AsyncPanel.
 *      If AsyncPanel is the child of a <code>java.awt.Window</code>, the window is repacked to take into account the
 *      new size of this panel.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>This panel tries to be as 'transparent' as possible for the target component: the borders of this panel are empty
 * and its layout is a <code>BorderLayout</code> where the target component is added to the center.</p>
