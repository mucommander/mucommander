/**
 * A descriptor class for {@link MuAction} instances. An ActionParameters is the combination of a MuAction
 * class (a class extending MuAction and following its conventions) and a set of properties used for instantiation.
 * Thus, it not only identifies an action class but also the way it is instantiated.
 *
 * <p>Two ActionParameters instances are equal only if:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>they refer to the same action ID
 *  <li>both sets of initialization properties are equal, i.e. they contain the same key/value pairs (deep equality)
 * </ul>
 * This means that two ActionParameters instances referring to the same MuAction ID but with a different set of
 * initialization properties will not be equal.
 *
 * <p>This class is used by ActionManager to instance MuAction and allow several instances to live in memory only if
 * they have different initialization properties, which translated into action speak means a different appearance
 * and/or behavior.
