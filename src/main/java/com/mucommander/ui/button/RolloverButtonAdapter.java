/**
 * This class allows to add a rollover effect to a <code>JButton</code>. Rollover-enabled buttons have no borders
 * by default. It is only when the mouse cursor is over the button that the button's borders get painted.
 * This rollover effect gives the user a visual indication that the button can be pressed (in other words, that the
 * button is indeed a button), while not cluttering the interface with button borders.
 * Such buttons are particularly effective for toolbars, where a large number of buttons are usually present.
 *
 * <p>
 * To 'rollover-enable' a button, the {@link #setButtonDecoration(javax.swing.JButton)} method must first be called to
 * set decoration properties. Then, the button must register an instance of <code>RolloverButtonAdapter</code> as a
 * mouse listener. Note that a single <code>RolloverButtonAdapter</code> instance can be registered with several buttons.  
 * </p>
