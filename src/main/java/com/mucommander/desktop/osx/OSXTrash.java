/**
 * OSXTrash provides access to the Mac OS X Finder's trash. Only local files (or locally mounted files) can be moved
 * to the trash.
 *
 * <p>
 *   <b>Implementation notes:</b><br/>
 *   <br/>
 *   This trash is implemented as a {@link com.mucommander.desktop.QueuedTrash} for several reasons:
 *   <ul>
 *    <li>the Finder plays a sound when it has been told to move a file to the trash and is done with it.
 *        Moving files to the trash repeatedly would play the sound as many times as the Finder has been told to move a
 *        file, which is obviously ugly.</li>
 *    <li>executing an AppleScript has a cost as it has to be compiled first. When files are moved repeatedly, it is
 *        more efficient to group files and execute only one AppleScript.</li>
 *   </ul>
 *   <br/>
 *   This class uses {@link com.mucommander.ui.macosx.AppleScript} to interact with the trash.
