 * AbstractTrash is an abstract representation of a file trash, i.e. a temporary place where deleted files are stored

 *
 * <p>Since AbstractTrash implementations are system-dependent, they should not be instantiated directly.
 * Use {@link DesktopManager#getTrash()} to retrieve an instance of a trash implementation that can
 * be used on the current platform.<br>
 * Also, some AbstractTrash subclasses may not be able to provide working implementations for all trash operations;
 * probe methods are provided to find out if a particular operation is available.</p>
