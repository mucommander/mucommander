/**
 * Used to explore a list of commands in a format independent fashion.
 * <p>
 * Different classes, such as {@link CommandManager} or {@link CommandReader}, know how to
 * generate a list of commands - from instances loaded in memory or from a file, for example.
 * Implementing <code>CommandBuilder</code> allows classes to query these lists regardless of
 * their source.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of <code>CommandBuilder</code> can rely on their methods to be called in the proper order,
 * and on both their {@link #startBuilding()} and {@link #endBuilding()} methods to be called. Classes that
 * interact with such instances must make sure this contract is respected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A (fairly useless) implementation might look like:
 * <pre>
 * public class CommandPrinter implements CommandBuilder {
 *    public void startBuilding() {System.out.println("Beginning command list building...");}
 *
 *    public void endBuilding() {System.out.println("Done.");}
 *
 *    public void addCommand(Command command) throws CommandException {
 *        System.out.println(" - creating command '" + command.getCommand() + "' with alias '" + command.getAlias() + "'");
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Passing an instance of <code>CommandPrinter</code> to {@link CommandManager#buildCommands(CommandBuilder)}
 * will result in something like:
 * <pre>
 * Beginning command list building...
 * - creating command 'open $f' with alias 'open'
 * - creating command 'open -a Safari $f' with alias 'openURL'
 * Done.
 * </pre>
 * </p>
