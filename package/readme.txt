muCommander v1.1.0
------------------

muCommander is a lightweight, cross-platform file manager with a dual-pane interface.
It runs on any operating system with Java support (macOS, Windows, Linux, *BSD, Solaris...).

Please visit the muCommander project page on GitHub (https://github.com/mucommander) to ask questions,
suggest features, report a bug or browse documentation. Your feedback is always welcome!

Official website: https://www.mucommander.com


Requirements
------------

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11 or later is required to run muCommander.
Java 17 is recommended, you can download it from https://adoptium.net/temurin.

If you're having problems launching muCommander, make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the directory
where your Java runtime is installed.


What's new since v1.0.1 ?
-----------------------

New features:
- Support SMBv2.
- Support RAR 5+.
- New archive formats: RPM, cpio.
- New 'Toggle terminal' action (defaults to F12) that shows/hides a new terminal view.

Improvements:
- Symbolic links are extracted properly from zip archives to the local file system.
- Local symbolic links are packed properly into zip and tar archives.
- Unpacking of 7z archives is now faster and more reliable using a newer native library.
- The filename cell is rendered differently when renaming a file to reflect that the filename is editable when no text is selected.
- Keyboard shortcuts on macOS better align with the default keyboard shortcuts in Safari.
- The 'About' dialog indicates when the portable version is used.
- Commands that are executed from the 'Run command' dialog are now typed within a terminal that recognizes shell aliases.
- When referencing an SMB server (smb://<server>/), its accessible shares are listed.
- Bonjour services are initialized asynchronously in order to accelerate startup time.

Localization:
-

Bug fixes:
- 'Move' action does not get stuck when an external file is dragged and dropped to the application.
- Symbolic links are extracted from archive files to the right location rather than to the destination base folder.
- Fix detection of the 'skopeo' binary that is used to connect to container registries.
- When extracting an item from an archive file to the archive file's parent folder, the archive file remains presented.

Known issues:
- Some translations may not be up-to-date.
- SMB support may not work properly on non multi-language JRE.
- 'Copy files to clipboard' not working with some applications (files are not pasted).
- Authentication issues when using several sets of credentials (login/password) for the same server.
- Untrusted HTTPS connections are allowed without a warning.
- Windows Vista/7: "java.net.SocketException: Permission denied: recv failed" error can appear when trying to access FTP
  sites. This seems to be a Windows firewall problem, with a possible workaround:
  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7077696
- Need to enable NTLM authentication manually in order to authenticate to Samba >= 4.5. This is done by adding 'ntlm auth = yes' to smb.conf.
- macOS: issues with browsing Documents/Desktop/Downloads may be solved by resetting Security and Privacy settings.
  See https://github.com/mucommander/mucommander/wiki/Reset-Security-&-Privacy-Settings-on-macOS for more details.
- macOS: muCommander may not start on older versions of macOS due to incompatibility of the bundled JRE.
- macOS: "Do you want the application "muCommander.app" to accept incoming network connections?" dialog keeps popping
  up on startup even if the dialog has been previously accepted (ticket #339), when 'Bonjour' support is enabled.
- macOS: some keyboard shortcuts may conflict with global system shortcuts.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

muCommander comes with a few command line switches.
The following options are available:
 -a FILE, --assoc FILE             Load associations from FILE.
 -b FILE, --bookmarks FILE         Load bookmarks from FILE.
 -c FILE, --configuration FILE     Load configuration from FILE
 -C FILE, --commandbar FILE        Load command bar from FILE.
 -e FOLDER, --extensions FOLDER    Load extensions from FOLDER.
 -f FILE, --commands FILE          Load custom commands from FILE.
 -i, --ignore-warnings             Do not fail on warnings (default).
 -k FILE, --keymap FILE            Load keymap from FILE
 -p FOLDER, --preferences FOLDER   Store configuration files in FOLDER
 -S, --silent                      Do not print verbose error messages
 -s FILE, --shell-history FILE     Load shell history from FILE
 -t FILE, --toolbar FILE           Load toolbar from FILE
 -u FILE, --credentials FILE       Load credentials from FILE
 -h, --help                        Print the help text and exit
 -v, --version                     Print the version and exit
 -V, --verbose                     Print verbose error messages (default)
 -w, --fail-on-warnings            Quits when a warning is encountered during
                                   the boot process.

In addition to these, muCommander will interpret anything that comes after the last switch as a URI and load it in
its windows.
So for example:

 mucommander -b ~/.bookmarks.xml ftp://user@myftp.com ~/dev http://slashdot.org

Will:
 - read bookmarks from ~/bookmarks.xml
 - load a connection to myftp.com in the left panel of the main window
 - load ~/dev in the right panel of the main window
 - open a second window and load http://slashdot.org in its left panel
 - load the default directory in the second window's fourth panel
