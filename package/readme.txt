Requirements
------------

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8 or later is required to run muCommander.
Java 1.8 is recommended, you can download it at http://java.com.

If you're having problems launching muCommander, make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the directory
where your Java runtime is installed.


What's new since v0.9.2 ?
-----------------------

New features:

Improvements:
- The last setting of single panel view for each window is now restored on startup.
- Add dark and light solarized themes.
- Enable compilation with Java 9 and Java 10.
- Select the whole text within the location text-field when the latter gains focus.

Localization:

Bug fixes:
- If custom folders are set, they are always loaded now on startup.

Known issues:
- Mac OS X: "muCommander damaged and cannot be opened" may appear after downloading muCommander from the browser. This
  can be solved by executing: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <jar_name>.jar
- Some translations may not be up-to-date.
- Mac OS X: "Do you want the application "muCommander.app" to accept incoming network connections?" dialog keeps popping
  up on startup even if the dialog has been previously accepted (ticket #339), when 'Bonjour' support is enabled.
- Executable permissions on local files are not properly preserved when running a unix-based OS with Java 1.5.
- SMB support may not work properly on non multi-language JRE.
- 'Copy files to clipboard' not working with some applications (files are not pasted).
- Mac OS X: some keyboard shortcuts may conflict with global system shortcuts.
- Authentication issues when using several sets of credentials (login/password) for the same server (see ticket #76).
- Untrusted HTTPS connections are allowed without a warning.
- Windows Vista/7: "java.net.SocketException: Permission denied: recv failed" error can appear when trying to access FTP
  sites. This seems to be a Windows firewall problem, with a possible workaround:
  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7077696
- Unpacking files from 7z archive files can be slow.
- Need to enable NTLM authentication manually in order to authenticate to Samba >= 4.5. This is done by adding 'ntlm auth = yes' to smb.conf.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

muCommander comes with a few command line switches.
The following options are available:
 -a FILE, --assoc FILE             Load associations from FILE.
 -b FILE, --bookmarks FILE         Load bookmarks from FILE.
 -c FILE, --configuration FILE     Load configuration from FILE
 -C FILE, --commandbar FILE        Load command bar from FILE.
 -e FOLDER, --extensions FOLDER    Load extensions from FOLDER.
 -f FILE, --commands FILE          Load custom commands from FILE.
 -i, --ignore-warnings             Do not fail on warnings (default).
 -k FILE, --keymap FILE            Load keymap from FILE
 -p FOLDER, --preferences FOLDER   Store configuration files in FOLDER
 -S, --silent                      Do not print verbose error messages
 -s FILE, --shell-history FILE     Load shell history from FILE
 -t FILE, --toolbar FILE           Load toolbar from FILE
 -u FILE, --credentials FILE       Load credentials from FILE
 -h, --help                        Print the help text and exit
 -v, --version                     Print the version and exit
 -V, --verbose                     Print verbose error messages (default)
 -w, --fail-on-warnings            Quits when a warning is encountered during
                                   the boot process.

In addition to these, muCommander will interpret anything that comes after the last switch as a URI and load it in
its windows.
So for example:

 mucommander -b ~/.bookmarks.xml ftp://user@myftp.com ~/dev http://slashdot.org

Will:
 - read bookmarks from ~/bookmarks.xml
 - load a connection to myftp.com in the left panel of the main window
 - load ~/dev in the right panel of the main window
 - open a second window and load http://slashdot.org in its left panel
 - load the default directory in the second window's fourth panel
