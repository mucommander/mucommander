Requirements
------------

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5 or later is required to run muCommander.
Java 1.6 is recommended, you can download it at http://java.com.

Mac OS X users: your favorite OS already comes with a Java runtime so you're good to go!

If you're having problems launching muCommander, make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the directory
where your Java runtime is installed.


What's new since v0.9 ?
-----------------------

New features:
- Lock tab capability, which prevents closing/moving the tab or changing its location.
- New quick list that presents open tabs in the current panel, mapped onto Alt+6 by default (ticket #450).
- Added the option to set fixed title for tab.
- Added the following actions: add tab, duplicate tab, clone tab to other panel.
- Added support for VMware vSphere virtual machines file system, contributed by Yuval Kohavi <yuval.kohavi@intigua.com>

Improvements:
- The state of all windows from last run is now restored on startup.
- Added the ability to copy the base name of files (ticket #462), contributed by Chen Rozenes.
- User can choose to always display tabs headers from preferences dialog (even when the panel contains single tab).
- Add the application name to window title on all OSs except Mac OS X (ticket #501).
- The visited locations history is now saved per-tab.
- The recently visited locations quick list now presents the visited locations on all tabs and windows.
- The content of recently visited locations quick list is now restored from previous run on startup (ticket #471).
- Added fullscreen support for Mac OS X Lion (ticket #468).
- Text file editor/viewer restore the full screen mode of last used (closed) editor/viewer on startup.
- 'Bonjour' support is now disabled by default on Mac OS (on fresh installation, i.e, with no previous 
  preferences) to prevent firewall dialog which keeps popping up on startup (workaround for ticket #339).
- Added 'ctrl+m' keystroke to toggle text file editor/viewer full screen mode.
- Tab can be closed by clicking on its header with middle mouse button.
- Assign 'ctrl+page_down' keystroke for switching to next tab, and 'ctrl+page_up' for switching to 
  previous tab (the keystrokes that were previously assigned to those actions remain as alternative keystrokes).
- Improved names and descriptions presented for tab-related actions.
- Added new category of actions in the 'shortcuts dialog' for tab-related actions.
- Changed tab's not-fixed-title to be in the pattern '<host>:<filename>'
- Show backward/forward locations list when pressing with right click on the back/forward buttons in the toolbar 
  instead of trigger back/forward actions
- Keyboard shortcuts can now be set for commands defined at commands.xml (ticket #456), contributed by Jarek Czekalski.
- Show empty name in the make file/directory dialog when it is opened (ticket #512), contributed by hclsiva.
- Mac OS X: enabled high-resolution rendering on Retina displays (ticket #518), contributed Alexey Lysiuk.
- Added Windows 8 and Mac OS X 10.8 to the OS versions.
- System files can now be filtered also on windows, contributed by Markus Bullmann.

Localization:
- Turkish translation has been updated.

Bug fixes:
- Prevent deadlock which caused the application to freeze while switching tabs on MAC OS.
- Recycle Bin is now working on Windows 64-bit with a 64-bit Java runtime (ticket #234).
- Key combinations that contain the TAB key can be set as shortcuts (ticket #465).
- Fix installation via software center on Ubuntu.
- Symbolic links cannot be opened (ticket #467).
- Encoding of text file is changed after being modified by the viewer/editor (ticket #438).
- Cannot connect to some FTP/SFTP bookmarks if there are more than 4 of them (ticket #525), contributed by Ondrej Dusek.
- Quick lists on the right panel sometimes not being focused (ticket #552), contributed by Jarek Czekalski.

Known issues:
- Some translations may not be up-to-date. Refer to http://trac.mucommander.com/wiki/Translations for more information.
- Mac OS X: "Do you want the application "muCommander.app" to accept incoming network connections?" dialog keeps popping
  up on startup even if the dialog has been previously accepted (ticket #339), when 'Bonjour' support is enabled.
- Executable permissions on local files are not properly preserved when running a unix-based OS with Java 1.5.
- SMB support may not work properly on non multi-language JRE.
- 'Copy files to clipboard' not working with some applications (files are not pasted).
- Mac OS X: some keyboard shortcuts may conflict with global system shortcuts.
- Authentication issues when using several sets of credentials (login/password) for the same server (see ticket #76).
- Untrusted HTTPS connections are allowed without a warning.
- Windows Vista/7: "java.net.SocketException: Permission denied: recv failed" error can appear when trying to access FTP
  sites. This seems to be a Windows firewall problem, with a possible workaround:

- Unpacking files from 7z archive files can be slow.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

muCommander comes with a few command line switches.
The following options are available:
 -a FILE, --assoc FILE             Load associations from FILE.
 -b FILE, --bookmarks FILE         Load bookmarks from FILE.
 -c FILE, --configuration FILE     Load configuration from FILE
 -C FILE, --commandbar FILE        Load command bar from FILE.
 -e FOLDER, --extensions FOLDER    Load extensions from FOLDER.
 -f FILE, --commands FILE          Load custom commands from FILE.
 -i, --ignore-warnings             Do not fail on warnings (default).
 -k FILE, --keymap FILE            Load keymap from FILE
 -p FOLDER, --preferences FOLDER   Store configuration files in FOLDER
 -S, --silent                      Do not print verbose error messages
 -s FILE, --shell-history FILE     Load shell history from FILE
 -t FILE, --toolbar FILE           Load toolbar from FILE
 -u FILE, --credentials FILE       Load credentials from FILE
 -h, --help                        Print the help text and exit
 -v, --version                     Print the version and exit
 -V, --verbose                     Print verbose error messages (default)
 -w, --fail-on-warnings            Quits when a warning is encountered during
                                   the boot process.

In addition to these, muCommander will interpret anything that comes after the last switch as a URI and load it in
its windows.
So for example:

 mucommander -b ~/.bookmarks.xml ftp://user@myftp.com ~/dev http://slashdot.org

Will:
 - read bookmarks from ~/bookmarks.xml
 - load a connection to myftp.com in the left panel of the main window
 - load ~/dev in the right panel of the main window
 - open a second window and load http://slashdot.org in its left panel
 - load the default directory in the second window's fourth panel
